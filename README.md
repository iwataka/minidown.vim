# Minidown

Minimalist markdown previwer

## Introduction

Minidown is a markdown previewer for minimalists. This doesn't require complex
settings but only [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) on your PATH. This doesn't have
live-preview feature and you should reload the browser page manually to update
the content - but you really need it ?

## Requirements

+ [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)
+ xdg-open (if you use Linux)

## Usage

Just run `:Minidown` command on your preferred markdown buffer and you can see
its content on your primary browser.
